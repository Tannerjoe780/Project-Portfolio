Welcome to my data analyst portfolio. I am a recent MBA graduate with a concentration in Data Analytics. I am a very driven person who tries to find the story in data and present that to the end user as cleanly as possible. This repository contains a small collection of projects showcasing my skills and experience in analyzing data to derive insights and make informed decisions. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and problem-solving within various domains.

Some of the prjects in this repository may require you to download an open them to see them correctly due to them being html files.
