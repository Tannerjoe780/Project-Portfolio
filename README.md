Welcome to my data analyst portfolio. I am a recent MBA graduate with a concentration in Data Analytics. I am a very driven person who tries to find the story in data and present that to the end user as cleanly as possible. This repository contains a small collection of projects showcasing my skills and experience in analyzing data to derive insights and make informed decisions. Each project demonstrates my proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, statistical analysis, and problem-solving within various domains.

Projects
1. Analyzing Loan Data

 This project is made up of two files Part I and Part II. In these files i utilize python to clean, arrange, and vizualize data.

2. Coffee Chain Data 

For this project I utilized a sample set of data from a coffee chain. This data was cleaned using excel and then vizualized in tableau. Include in that file is a dynamic dashboards and a storyboard.
