    "# Wrangle and Analyze Data \n",
    "## Udacity Project\n",
    "### By: Joseph Tanner\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Introduction\n",
    "\t In this project we are given the task of wrangling data from three different data sources. Cleaning this data effectively based on quality and tidiness concept taught throughout this block. Then finally merging this data into a master data file that is clean and can be used for data analyses. Throughout this project we will be practicing and demonstrating the skills taught to us on how to wrangle data effectively. \n",
    "#### Data Sources\n",
    "\tThe three sources of data we are given are twitter-archive-enhanced.csv. This is a file that contains archived tweet data from twitter. The next one is image-predictions.tsv this is a file that contains tweet data and dog breed predictions based on the picture. The third file was a tweet-json.txt file that we scaped twitter for. \n",
    "#### Wrangling the Data\n",
    "\tBelow will be the quality issues found in each file and following that will be the tidiness issues.\n",
    "twitter-archive-enhanced.csv\n",
    "1.)\tThis files is missing some ratings values that we will need to extract. This is important for proper analysis.\n",
    "2.)\tThe denominators of the dogs needs to be unified to 10 for accurate comparison.\n",
    "3.)\tThere are outliers in the numerator. We will use tweet text to fix these.\n",
    "4.)\tTime stamp column needs to be changed to date format and drop the time. This will make for easier visualization.\n",
    "5.)\tThe columns for retweet data need to be dropped. The instructions said we needed to base this off of original tweets so the retweet data can be dropped.\n",
    "6.)\tThe tweet_id column needs to be string for merging.\n",
    "image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "1.)\tTweet id needs to be changed to string to be merged later.\n",
    "2.)\tThe dog breeds column needs the _ removed and there is inconsistency with capitalized first letters so we will make them all lowercase.\n",
    "tweet-json.txt\n",
    "1.)\tTweet_id needs to be string to merge later.\n",
    "Tidiness Issues\n",
    "1.)\tThe twiiter-archive-enhanced.csv has four columns for a dog type. These can be made one column based on tidiness rules.\n",
    "2.)\tAll three data sources should be merged because they contain similar data.\n",
    "#### Cleaning The Data\n",
    "\tTo clean the data I made all the changes that were needed based on my assessment. I tried to remove columns that were unnecessary. I made sure to change datatypes when necessary so calculations or functions could be used. I also tried to make the data more visually adept. \n",
    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\tI made 11 changes total to help make the data easier to analyze. 9 of these changes were quality and 2 were tidiness. The complete Masterfile at the end was named twitter_archive_master.csv via project instructions. This file had 14 columns and 1777 rows. This file may still contain some errors and could be analyzed further, although I feel I have shown my ability to wrangle data and then give insight and visualizations. \n"
